## 1.Implement a camera with an orthographic projection, and remove the centering trick used in the second part of the assignment. Place a mesh in the scene such that it is visible
(i.e. it is inside the view volume). Allow the user to change the view volume (e.g. up,down, left, right, near, far) and compare the result with two different view volume. Note:
near and far should not affect the rendering in this assignment.
